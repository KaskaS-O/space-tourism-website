## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - client side routing for React
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This was really a challenge, since it was my first app with multiple subpages. It was also first opportunity to work with Figma, which I can tell I enjoyed.

The most challenging for me was understanding how to create and use router and how to pass data between components. After completing this challenge I feel I have a basic understanding of it. Using some of the React Router components (like Outlet or NavLink) was a great in practice learning of the concept.

### Continued development

The most important improvement would be making it possible to refresh the page and keeping data available during the process and allowing to enter the page not only through root route, but through children routes as well.

Second idea I came up with is to add an animation on Crew, Destination and Technology pages to change active children within time intervals (e.g. switching between Moon, Mars, Venus and Europa every couple of seconds).
